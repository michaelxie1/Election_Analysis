# Election_Analysis



The purpose of the election audit was to analyze this election in terms of how many people voted for which candidate and which area they were from. From this data, it could be possible to draw correlations between both geography and political interests, and see how both perspectives would affect one another. It allowed for us to also learn the basics of python and utilize it to find specific information that we needed, such as the voting percentages for both the candidates and counties. 

-	The number of votes casted during this congressional election would be 369,711.
-	Of the three counties, Denver contained the highest number of votes, followed by Jefferson then Arapahoe. Denver is seen to contain more votes than the other two counties combined.  
-	Denver had the largest number of votes at 82.8%, with more than 300000 voters.
-	In terms of the candidates, Diana won the majority of the votes, earning more votes than the other two candidates combined. Although Charles followed her at 23%, Raymon was shown to only have won 3.1% of the total votes.
-	Diana DeGette won the election, with 272,892 votes at 73.8% of the total votes.

This Python script could be utilized on any election as long as the fields are changed to match the criteria. Since the script is able to go through the results and find the percentage of people voting for what candidate, it doesn’t matter what year is utilized, as the basic structure stays the same and only the actual data changes. For example, to modify the script to go through a different year, many of the fields wouldn’t even have to change in order to analyze it. Even if the city wanted to go a step further and analyze know information regarding cities than counties, each field going through counties could be changed to cities and achieve the same result.
